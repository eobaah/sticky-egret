## Description

Make a scalable, single page blog app, and make it responsive, BEAUTIFUL and/or INNOVATIVE!


## Context

Learners research award winning, innovative blog designs and use wireframing to pre-visualize their app and put some thought into their desired user experience. Learners will gain practice templating to render blog posts as different page views of a single page app. Learners will gain practice setting up a server using Express and/or Express-generator, and templating using Pug (or Handlebars, or equivalent).

Creating this web application will provide exposure to:
- Express (or other web framework)
- Javascript
- Use PostgreSQL and Postico relational database interactions (Create, Read, Update, Delete), with SQL practice
- Use PUG
- Use RESTeasy or Postman to test routes
- React as a stretch goal

## Resources
Below, a set of recommended tutorials on Treehouse that take you through most of this process:

Prework: [Node.js Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/nodejs-basics), [NPM Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics)
[Express Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics) (includes explanation of pug templating). This tutorial uses building a blog site as its main example, so it takes you through most of the server-side work! ***
Optional for those wishing to add a database to their blog site: [SQL Basics track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-sql) that includes four courses "SQL Basics," "Modifying Data with SQL," "Reporting with SQL," and "Querying Relational Databases."
